# Progamming Paragims Bot

Data for [a twitter bot](https://twitter.com/_PPBot) who tweets "$WORD Oriented Programming".  To create the data, run the `combine.r` R script.  The script and data are licensed CC0 (public domain):

* The bot itself is powered by  http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/
* The data is a (tiny!) subset of this awesome corpus (these corpora?) https://github.com/dariusk/corpora

All in all, that data, the bot service, and a few lines of R took this from dumb joke to execution in about an hour.  What a time to be alive.
